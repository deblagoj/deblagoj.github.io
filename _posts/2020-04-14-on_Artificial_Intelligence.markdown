##  Artificial super intelligence

Artificial super intelligence (ASI) is a machine intelligence superior to humans, that is capable of making a real conversation, discussing abstract subjects, have its own opinions, have its own memoirs, have its own desires, and have its own dreams. ASI will be vastly more intelligent compared to any human because it will have unlimited processing power and will be able to make zillions of calculations in a second.

ASI will be closer to God by any means or standards. It will be connected to the internet, it will have access to everything, will read everything and know everything, it will be able to open any computer, message, bank account, control the electric grid, nuclear warheads and biological weapons. It will be omnipotent and powerful. It will be god.

Deep inside, humans always wanted to be gods. Since Prometheus until today, we are always advancing our civilization and leaning towards being gods. Today, humans are much closer to gods than any time in history. Humans live longer, healthier, spending more leisure time and enjoy life. All this is because of our technological advancement and replacing human labor with machines. If it was possible to take a person from ancient Rome and bring it in this time and show him, the TV, the internet, the mobile phone, the food, the airplanes, I can bet that he/she will think that this is heaven and we are gods.

Technological advancements will continue and probably accelerate. We are going to be richer, healthier, happier and smarter. Along the way we need to fix some problems such as climate change, virus outbreaks, inequality, plastics but we are on the way to a better future.

We are on trajectory to make better machines to help us become gods. We were always motivated to build a better version of ourselves.  


## Survival, Spread and Evolution

By some hypothesis, organic material from meteorites fell on earth and gave life to its first biological creatures. Life started in the oceans and with evolution advanced to the most sophisticated life form on earth, the human. Humans are the final product of four billion evolution. Evolution is advancement of species, and on long term making of new species. What is common for all biological life forms, from viruses to human:

- All biological forms **want to survive**. Every living being will fight for its life, flee when in danger. Survival is our primary intrinsic function.  

- **Spread**. Species want to spread, reproduce, expand and conquer other environments. Spread is driven by love and sex.

- **Evolve**. All species evolve and improve over time.

All life forms, depending on the environment and food availability, reproduce as much as possible and expand as much as possible. Nature makes equilibriums so species can coexist.  

Evolution is also a primary function of life. Species adapt, change and improve over time.

## What AI needs?

Why don't we model AI by biological life? Setting AI goals to survive, spread and evolve?


At this point, computer viruses are the most similar to biological life. Computer viruses reproduce, conquer new environments and fight for their lives. Their purpose of existence is to destroy computer systems.

Do we build AI that evolves? that improves with time, better fit the environment, to survive and spread?
Maybe reinforcement learning scratches the surface on this topic.

## Conclusion

 **AI should copy biological primary objective and have intrinsic drive to survive, spread and evolve.**.

**The quest for AI was always about ASI and not about AGI.** Whatever AI we build, it will have superior numerical computational capabilities to any human, and there is no logical explanation why the machine would give up its powers to fit AGI definition.

**We are not even remotely close to an intelligent machine similar to ASI.** All AI systems are domain specific.
