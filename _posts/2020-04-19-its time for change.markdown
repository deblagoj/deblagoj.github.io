Reflections on [IT'S TIME TO BUILD](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/) by Marc Andreessen.

Yea, it's time to build, as always, but I would say it more time to ***change***.

Do USA needs a massive build in housing, hospitals and education to revive the American dream?


Does USA have enough houses to fit everyone in? Do rich folks really need 10+ houses, 15+ villas and 20+ cars? Can someone sleep in 12 beds, or be in 7 villas at the same time? Do someone really needs 15 bedroom house?
A policy change can make housing affordable and accessible, rapidly. You don’t need to build, just change. Somewhere there is need to build e.g. SF, but again is probably deeply a policy problem.

USA pays significantly more to healthcare and get much less compared to any western develop country. The UK royal birth cost as much as any birth in the USA! USA lifespan is less than most of develop countries due to lack of access to basic healthcare. It is just shameful.

Education. Similar story as the healthcare. You pay you gain.

USA has top notch housing, hospitals and education for the rich, and 3-class for the rest. It just a plain fact, that got more visible by COVID-19.

Building is a change by-product. The basic healthcare needs more hospitals, the education more schools and teachers and housing more construction.

#### Building by itself won’t solve the problems. Maybe rich will get an extra villa, another health insurance and college fund. This has happened before.

I am not a communist or socialist. On the contrary I am deep believer in capitalism, individualism, competition and free market. That said I believe that in 22 century we need more humanism, solidarity and cooperation. More altruism and less greed, more love and less hate. If this was the case COVID-19 would be finished by now.
