- You are not there to make friends.

- What you do doesn’t really matter if you can’t show what you have been doing. Have a good presence at the office.

- Always dress properly. It’s a confidence booster.

- Don’t mix your office group and personal groups. Never.

- Say no to things that you are not capable of doing or you don’t have time to do.

- You can’t please all the colleagues. Trying to do so is the waste of time.

- Everyone is replaceable. Only thing that matters is the time and effort that is required to replace that person.

- People will break your trust and back-stab you and use you to climb ladders. Don’t take it personally but keep your eyes open.

- You must pay for every resource or service that you use one way or another.

- Don’t argue with your manager or try to prove them. In case you don’t already know, your boss is always right.

- Treat people with respect and don’t lose your cool easily. Always have a positive attitude.

- Follow the rules and respect the organizational policy. You might feel like rebelling by not doing so but trust me it will impact you in the longer run.

- Don’t spend too much time with colleagues. 8 hours a day is more than enough.

- Don’t share your next move with anyone. Keep it a secret.

- Don’t share your weakness with anyone. You never know who is going to use it against you.

- Use politically correct language to avoid any harassment cases.

- Always do your job even if no one is watching or noticing you. Your work should be your first priority.

- Anything else can always wait during your office hours. This is a habit and it will take you a long way in life.

- Your office will fire you any day they don’t require you. So, make yourself ready to sell in the market. Learn new skills and keep networking with people.

- You are more likely to get promoted if you switch departments or offices rather than waiting for the same position.

- Don’t try to be the smart ass person who keeps throwing sarcastic comments all the time. Be helpful !

The end.
