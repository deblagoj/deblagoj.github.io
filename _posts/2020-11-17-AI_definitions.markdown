AI definitions by Christopher Manning shared on his Twitter.

I have spend a lot of time thinking about **AI** definitions.

I disagree with the Intelligence definition in the part of "A fully pre-programmed factory robot is flexible, accurate, and consistent but not intelligent"

[What if the programmed factory robot is capable of learning and achieving goals and makes optimal actions in an uncertain and ever-varying world? Isn't that intelligence? This is contrary to the first sentence.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/blagojdelipetrev_christopher-manning-on-twitter-activity-6734427988814909440-5-H0)
