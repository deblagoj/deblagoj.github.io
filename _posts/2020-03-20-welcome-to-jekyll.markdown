CoronaVirus is an unpresented crysis that requre decisive actions. Here I will hihglight some of the topics that I think are relevant for resolving this crysis faster and what do we need to do after the crysis.

The world countries were completely unprepared for CoronaVirus outbreak. Only the countries in Azia had some previous experince with Sars and other virus outbreaks that gave them heads up and obviously they have resolved the crysis. China, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong are all CoronaVirus free right now.

Europe and USA expecially were completely unprepared.

The CoronaVirus will be a decisive test of the societies and systems resilience. It will shape the future world systems.





You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

you can [get the PDF](/assets/paper.pdf) directly.

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
