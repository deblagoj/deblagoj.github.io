CoronaVirus is an unpresented crysis that requre decisive actions. Here I will hihglight some of the topics that I think are relevant for resolving this crysis faster and what do we need to do after the crysis.

The world countries were completely unprepared for CoronaVirus outbreak. Only the countries in Azia had some previous experince with Sars and other virus outbreaks that gave them heads up and obviously they have resolved the crysis. China, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong are all CoronaVirus free right now.

Europe and USA expecially were completely unprepared.

The CoronaVirus will be a decisive test of the societies and systems resilience. It will shape the future world systems.

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

This is a demo of all styled elements in Jekyll Now.

[View the markdown used to create this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barryclark/www.jekyllnow.com/gh-pages/_posts/2014-6-19-Markdown-Style-Guide.md).

This is a paragraph, it's surrounded by whitespace. Next up are some headers, they're heavily influenced by GitHub's markdown style.

## Header 2 (H1 is reserved for post titles)##

### Header 3

#### Header 4

A link to [Jekyll Now](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/). A big ass literal link <http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/>

An image, located within /images

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jekyll-logo.png "an image title")

* A bulletted list
- alternative syntax 1
+ alternative syntax 2
  - an indented list item

1. An
2. ordered
3. list

Inline markup styles:

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()`

> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote

Syntax highlighting can be used by wrapping your code in a liquid tag like so:

{{ "{% highlight javascript " }}%}  
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}  

creates...

{% highlight javascript %}
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{% endhighlight %}

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  

Finally, horizontal lines
