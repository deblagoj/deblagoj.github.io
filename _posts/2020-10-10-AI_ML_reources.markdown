**Intro**

There are many awesome** resources for AI, ML, and DL**. The two great books to start with:



*   **[Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)**
*   **[Machine Learning](http://profsite.um.ac.ir/~monsefi/machine-learning/pdf/Machine-Learning-Tom-Mitchell.pdf)**

These two books give a complete overview of the entire AI and ML field and are the most widely used teaching books. My suggestion is to start with "Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach" and then read "Machine Learning". The book "Machine Learning" is a little bit more specific and gets to the point so it is more difficult for beginners.

Some other resources and courses worth checking out:



*   **[AI For Everyone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone)**
*   **[Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/)**
*   **[Artificial Intelligence](https://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbook.io/artificial-inteligence/)**
*   **[FastAI](https://www.fast.ai/)**
*   **[Deep Learning demystified](https://deeplearningdemystified.com/)**

**Deep learning (DL)**

DL caused the last AI renaissance. Tensorflow (TF) and **[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)** are the two main frameworks. I am biased towards TF because I never had time to learn PyTorch. The two DL books implemented in TF:



*   **[Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python)** (**[Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks)**)
*   **[Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/)** (**[Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml)**)

 Both books have amazing Jupyter notebook examples. Extra book:



*   **[Dive into Deep Learning](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en)** (**[Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en)**)
*   **[Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)**

**[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner)** and **[Keras](https://keras.io/)** resources are also amazing.

**[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)** and **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** are crucial resources to learn AI, ML, and DL. **I cannot overstate how important they are**. Kaggle hosts many competitions with datasets, models, and source code. I have learned a lot about AI implementations from **[Kaggle's discussions](https://www.kaggle.com/drn01z3/end-to-end-baseline-with-u-net-keras)**. GitHub provides freely available source code, courses, models, and many more. 

GPU(s) are a must. **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** and **[Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/)** are worth checking out. Colab has a generous free tier. Home PC GPU(s) is a good option.

**[Twitter](https://twitter.com/)** is to follow AI news (or aggregator .e.g **[Populast](https://populast.com/ai/)**). **[Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/)** the latest in AI.

Last but not least, **[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)** has an answer to any question, problem, or issue.

**More**

The AI field is still evolving rapidly. There are many fabulous resources for each AI domain such as vision, language, robots, etc. More resources:

**Thanks for reading**

If I missed some important resources please make a comment. Hope you will find something useful.

Happy learning!
