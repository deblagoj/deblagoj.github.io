The [Pie & AI: Real-world AI Applications in Medicine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp7qqjlBeRY&feature=youtu.be ) presentation shared valuable key messages and an inevitable advertising of the new Coursera [AI for Medicine Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine) course.

### Eric Topol (@EricTopol)
* AI in medicine will make services and devices better, faster, cheaper and more accessible.
* Medicine is still not digitalized, doctors use stethoscope that is 3 centuries old device.
* Breakthrough devices like [Lung ultrasound smartphone device](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/ )  will make medical services accessible and available everywhere, and cost effective.
* AI medical virtual assistants. My opinion, they are way off and will happen first in apps like Alexa, Google Now, Siri etc.
* The Book: [Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Medicine-Artificial-Intelligence-Healthcare/dp/1541644638)

### Andrew Ng (@AndrewYNg)
* Why AI in medicine devices and services are not there yet?

The AI medical prototypes work well in the lab and high-end hospitals but often poorly in general hospitals. This is due to many reasons: the different types of devices and IT equipment, not enough representative and small datasets, non uniform data distributions, etc. All these leads to robustness and generalization problems that are major bottlenecks in getting these AI systems in production.

* Hospital staff is opposing change because these AI systems are completely changing their nature of work.  

* Communication gap between medical and computer scientist.

* ***Most of the medical equipment is digital. Data is already there. AI is not!!!***.

### Overall

***Big Medical dataset are prerequest and desperately needed !***

***We as society spend our best brains on online advertising and not on medical apps.***
Medical applications have bigger impact both financially and societally.

***AI & Medicine needs more people to make it happen.***
