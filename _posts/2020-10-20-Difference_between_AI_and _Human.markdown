## Intro

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence demonstrated by machines in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. One of AI's goals is to simulate the human brain and make intelligent machines.

The neuron is the human brain's building element. The transistor is the AI's building element. Biological neurons are much more complex than machine transistors. The brain is a hierarchical structure of biological neurons. The computer is a hierarchical structure of transistors. The brain can process massive amounts of visual, sound, touch, smell sensors data. The computer is blazingly fast in numerical computation. People build computers as tools for automatic data processing machines. Human and Machine intelligence is different in its essence, as their building block is, neurons and transistors.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) got inspiration from biological neurons. The ANN building block is the artificial neuron. An artificial neuron is significantly simpler than biological neurons. The artificial neuron is computationally faster and improves on a yearly scale. The biological neuron is evolving on millions of years scale.


Computers can make trillions of calculations per second and perform AI tasks that no human can comprehend. These tasks include:

* Object recognition in billions of images in a few seconds.
* Instantaneous translation of 100+ languages.
* Identification of spam from billions of emails.
* Playing chess, the game of Go, Jeopardy, Dota, etc.

In these tasks, AI excels humans.

AI lacks the capabilities of a four-year-old child to understand the world. AI is incapable of understanding abstract concepts or sharing knowledge across domains. AI doesn't understand causality or e.g. why objects fail on the ground. AI is powerful in one specific domain. Humans are born with an innate knowledge encoded in our DNA and improved by billions of years of evolution.
AI complements humans in many aspects of (digital) society. AI is implemented in Instagram, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple apps, and much of our digital world. AI helps us be more productive and freer us from repetitive tasks.

As AI is more adopted across services and industries, its influence on our lives, decisions, and society is growing. **“With great power comes great responsibility”**
