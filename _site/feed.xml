&lt;p&gt;AI for non-experts (AIFNE) is the intersection between &lt;strong&gt;no-code AI, low-code AI, AutoML, Declarative ML, MLOps&lt;/strong&gt; and requires minimal knowledge. AIFNE have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Graphical User Interface (GUI)  with drag-and-drop components or wizard-based interfaces to work with datasets, models, and AI algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AutoML to automate ML models creation without writing code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI (artificial intelligence) has progressed from an academic endeavor to a pervasive technology used everywhere. AI-powered products are now integrated into every aspect of our digital lives and recommend what to watch, where to eat, what to wear, how to communicate, predict search queries and provide seamless language translation. For these reasons, AI and machine learning (ML) has become central to the strategy of companies, organizations and governments which are feeling the pressure to innovate and reinvent themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The growing demand for AI is being hampered by scarcity of data scientists and AI experts. Many governments, public organizations, and non-tech companies that need to adopt AI solutions are facing a lack of knowledge and high costs. According to survey by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/deloitte-analytics/us-da-2017-deloitte-state-of-cognitive-survey.pdf#page=12&quot;&gt;Deloitte&lt;/a&gt;, 47% of companies had difficulty integrating AI into their current systems and 40% cited cost as a significant impendent. Furthermore, 37% of managers said they lacked the necessary expertise to implement AI, making AI and its benefits inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While domain experts communicate about their problem domain, AI experts communicate about AI models and optimization algorithms. AI experts and domain experts may well have divergent project objectives. Domain experts’ primary goal is to solve a specific problem, whereas AI experts’ primary goal can be to advance a complex AI algorithm. The communication gap and goal alignment can be exacerbated in projects with multiple stakeholders and differing educational and professional backgrounds. Many AI projects fail or are not adopted because of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acceptance and trust are lagging behind AI technology advancement. There is a divide between people who use AI and those who do not. As a result, people that are less informed frequently reject and distrust AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, people who train and use AI models are typically experienced developers with years of experience working within large organizations. The next wave of AI automaton should allow a significantly larger number of people, potentially without any coding skills, to perform the same tasks. These new AI systems will not require users to fully understand many of the details and provide them with a more abstract interface that is less demanding and more familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI for non-experts (AIFNE) is answer to these challenges. AI for non-experts is a code-free technology that will allows anyone to create and test their ideas without having AI technical knowledge. This technology is an intersection between &lt;strong&gt;no-code AI, low-code AI, AutoML,Declarative ML, MLOps&lt;/strong&gt; and requires minimal knowledge. AIFNE have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment with drag-and-drop components or wizard-based interfaces to work with datasets, models, and AI algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AutoML to automate ML models creation without writing code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/traditional-vs-new-ai-pipeline.png&quot; alt=&quot;traditional vs new ai pipeline&quot; class=&quot;bigger-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional AI lifecycle starts with data preparation, feature extraction, model selection, fine tuning, model training and deployment and obtaining results. These steps require complex code and specialized software and hardware infrastructure. AIFNE lifecycle is focused on the user and results as shown in Figure 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No-code technology is replacing code with drag and drop interfaces in the same way that Windows and MacOS have replaced the terminal. WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) solutions like Dreamweaver and MS FrontPage became emerging fields in no-code web development in 1997. Automation and no-code solutions in many domains in software development are brining immense productivity boost. Regular users can now build an application with a browser replacing an army of engineers.  Powerful applications that only large business or research organization have been able to afford are becoming norm for small and medium companies and organization. Soon, same will happen with AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vast amount of initiatives claims that they democratise AI. Out of all these initiatives, only those that are building AI for non-experts tools get the closest to the ideal of “any person without prior training”. Democratization of AI will bring more adoption, acceptance, education and trust in AI.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jamesfoster</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="markdown" /><category term="components" /><category term="extra" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4001/assets/images/markdown.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4001/assets/images/markdown.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Bitt Solutions</title><link href="http://localhost:4001/bitt-solutions/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bitt Solutions" /><published>2017-08-31T22:10:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-08-31T22:10:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4001/bitt-solutions</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4001/bitt-solutions/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;bitt-solutions-unlimited&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bitt.solutions&quot;&gt;Bitt Solutions Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
