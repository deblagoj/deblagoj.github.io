I am a computer scientist with two PhDs in machine learning and cloud computing. As a Scientific project officer at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, I've been working on AI and data policies since 2017. I have been a full professor of computer science since 2021. I am a former CEO/CTO with knowledge and experience in contract negotiation, project management and stakeholder management, creating and leading remote teams, and delivering solutions. I have worked in the government, academia, and the private sector.

My main project is AI WATCH, a European Commission body that monitors the development, adoption, and impact of artificial intelligence in Europe. I have contributed to <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/search?query=delipetrev"> several strategic AI documents as well as policy recommendations from the European Commission.</a>

<a href="https://bitt.solutions">Bitt Solutions </a> was founded in 2016. Bitt Solution is an outsourcing and consulting firm. We have worked for companies in the United States and Europe, solving various problems such as optimal workforce schedulers, AI real estate lead generators and providing AI solutions to our customers.

My academic career began in 2007, when I began a PhD program at the University of Cyril and Methodius. I created a hybrid multi-cloud computing application that runs on three different cloud providers: AWS, Google Cloud, and a private cloud. In 2010, I was awarded the prestigious Netherlands Fellowship Programme scholarship and enrolled in a PhD program at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/">TU Delft </a> and UNESCO-IHE. My PhD thesis focused on the application of machine learning algorithms. In April 2016, I successfully defended my second PhD thesis. I've been an associate professor since 2016. In 2021, I got promoted to full professor. 


 Accomplishments:
- Ranked first among the top five students in my generation.
- Macedonia's first full PhD scholarship from the Dutch government .
- Macedonia's first CA among the 3500+ employees of the European Commission Joint Research Center.
