    The post from Issac Asimov  <a href="https://talentdevelop.com/articles/WIIA.html"> "What Is Intelligence, Anyway?" </a>, provoke me to write this short blog. 


<p>
Asimov has scored 160 on test of intelignce, while his auto-repair man 80. His highest score do not allow him to repair cars, infact if the inteligence test was produced for auto-mehanics then Asimov would be rated as moron. Same applies for other professison, as carpenter or farmer.

<p>
One person inteligence is therefore not an absolute number but a function of the society. 

</p>

<p>
I think that, if a person has high IQ score, that is a sign of inteligence. That person  should try to find problems, often high level, where these skills will matter. Education, training and continus learning are essencial to sucess. The high IQ is just an advantage.

<p>
If I make a paralel with  car, lets say that high IQ is a Ferrary and low IQ is a Fiat Panda. To utulize Ferarry, you need a lot of gassoline. Gassoline translates to education, traning and learning. Also, you need good roads. Roads represent the society. If the right combination of Ferarry, lot of gasoline and great roads are combined, the full potential is achieved. Fiat Panda with a lot of fuel and good roads can go far too. So, the advice is, if you are smart and have high IQ, go to society that appriciate your skills and try to put as much as possible education, traning and learnign in your brain.

And find a place where your talents, skills are appriciated. A bottle of water cost 20 cents in the supermarket, same bottle cost 1 euro in the restorant, and 5 euro in the airport. Location matterrs.
