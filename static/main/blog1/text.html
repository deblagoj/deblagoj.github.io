 
<p><h1>Building a Personal Web Page in Hours, Not Days, with GPT-4</h1>
<p>If you've been following my posts, you'll know I'm an avid supporter of ChatGPT and GPT-4. Eager to test GPT-4's coding capabilities, I had the idea to revamp my outdated personal web page. Having been well-acquainted with Django and Bootstrap, and being somewhat of a Python aficionado, I thought these tools would serve me best for this project.</p>
<p>Inquisitively, I sought advice from GPT-4:</p>

  </div>

<p>Unbeknownst to me, it's possible to generate a static website from your Django project using a tool like django-distill, and subsequently host it on GitHub Pages. This revelation presented itself as the perfect solution.</p>
<p>Without further ado, I submitted my first prompt to GPT-4: &quot;I would prefer to build it in Django and Bootstrap.&quot; To my delight, GPT-4 provided a detailed outline on how to initiate this task:</p>

  </div>

<p>Curious and eager to keep the momentum, my subsequent prompts were centered around the next steps:</p>

  </div>
<p>Interestingly, GPT-4 was able to assist me in real-time debugging. Whenever I encountered issues, I simply pasted the error messages into the prompt, and GPT-4 would provide me with solutions:</p>

  </div>
<p>Furthermore, I found GPT-4 extremely helpful in refining my content, by condensing verbose paragraphs into more web-friendly formats:</p>
<p>In the end, I felt a profound sense of gratitude towards GPT-4 for enabling me to create my personal webpage with such ease and efficiency.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The coding and debugging capabilities of GPT-4 are simply astounding. Had I started this project from scratch without GPT-4, it would've taken me five times longer. In my opinion, GPT-4 is a clear contender to StackOverflow, and I foresee myself utilizing GPT-4 substantially more in the future.</p>
<p>GPT-4 has the potential to significantly boost software productivity. I can't stress enough how beneficial it would be for anyone involved in coding. It's like having StackOverflow, but with the perfect answer every time.</p>
<p>Beyond that, GPT-4 offers valuable recommendations on which services to use. Prior to this project, I was oblivious to the existence of django-distill and the ability to generate static pages.</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly the future of coding, and there's no turning back.</p>
